I graudated highschool last year and initially enrolled in college but I hated how slow it went and decided to learn cybersecurity instead of enrolling for another semester. I earned the Google Cybersecurity Professional certificate in eight days and I've been continuously learning since then.

## Objective

I've always loved solving problems and learning new things, so cybersecurity was very attractive to me. Escpecially after completing labs myself and having to use what I know and learn things I didn't know to get through them. My goal right now is to get an entry level role in cybersecurity like a tier 1 SOC analyst or a cybersecurity analyst so I can get into the industry and start solving real world problems.
